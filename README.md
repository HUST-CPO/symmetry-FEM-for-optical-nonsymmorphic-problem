nonsymmorphic symmetry FEM for light band structure problem
## Overview
The Open-source MATLAB package nonsymmorphic symmetry adapted FEM is an optical finite element program used for band structure problems. Based on the symmetry in group theory, it can divide the original problem into several sub-tasks and truncate the computational domain. This program significantly enhances the computational efficiency for band structure analysis problems. We provided examples of photonic crystal gratings with plane group pg, twisted quadrupole topological photonic crystals with plane group pg and photonic nodal line space group, respectively.
